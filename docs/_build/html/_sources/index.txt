Introduction
============
This software was written in order to fulfill a perceived lack of tools that can identify, from RNA-Seq data, high confidence fusions and circular RNA.  There are many other tools to discover fusions in RNA, and a handful of other tools to discover circular RNA.  We have endeavored to create the lowest possible false-positive rate for fusion detection, while creating helpful and convenient output files.  We’ve also emphasized the need for short running times in order to make this software useful for enormous data sets.  

Installation
============
STARChip was written to work in a \*nix shell-like environment, using Bash, Perl, and R extensively.  To use this on Windows, a shell emulator such as Cygwin is likely necessary.  It will probably work in Mac OS, but this is untested and likely there will be formatting issues.  At this point we will assume you are in a \*nix shell: 
Within the directory you\'d like the software installed: 

``git clone https://github.com/LosicLab/starchip.git``

Please ensure that the files in starchip/ and starchip/scripts/*/ have execute permission:

::

	chmod +x starchip/*sh
	chmod +x starchip/*pl
	chmod +x starchip/scripts/*/*sh
	chmod +x starchip/scripts/*/*pl


That\'s it!  
There are a number of software dependencies.  These should be callable without a full path (ie they should be included in your $PATH) :

- Bedtools >= 2.24.0 (https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2)
- R (https://www.r-project.org/ )
- R packages gplot, limma, edgeR (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) 
- STAR (https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR).  Not v2.6.0a or 2.6.0b.  Any other recent release should work.  
Fusions Only:

- Samtools (http://www.htslib.org/)
- Mafft (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/)

Setup
=====

STAR
----- 
STARChip is written to be an extension of the STAR read aligner.  It is optional for STARChip to run STAR on your samples. In most instances to run STARChip you must first run star on each of your samples.  See the STAR documentation for installation, as well as building or downloading a STAR genome index.  It is **absolutely critical** however, that you follow the STAR manual\'s instructions and **build a genome using all chromosomes plus unplaced contigs**.  Not doing so will strongly inflate your false positives rate, because reads that map perfectly to an unplaced contig will instead find the next best alignment, often a chimeric alignment.  Run STAR with the following parameters required for chimeric output: --chimSegmentMin X --chimJunctionOverhangMin X (where X is an integer).  Your project will have it\'s own requirements, but a good starting point for your star alignments might look like: 

``STAR --genomeDir /path/to/starIndex/ --readFilesIn file1_1.fastq.gz file1_2.fastq.gz --runThreadN 11 --outReadsUnmapped Fastx --quantMode GeneCounts 
--chimSegmentMin 15 --chimJunctionOverhangMin 15 --outSAMstrandField intronMotif --readFilesCommand zcat --outSAMtype BAM Unsorted --chimOutType Junctions SeparateSAMold``

Note that the final flag, "--chimOutType Junctions SeparateSAMold" should be omitted for versions of STAR v2.5 or earlier. 

Reference/BED Files
-------------------
STARChip makes use of gtf files for annotating fusions and circRNA with gene names.  However, we require them in ucsc bed file format.  We also require a bedtools .genome file to aid in sorting.  These can automatically be generated from your gtf file using the command\:

``/starchip/setup.sh /path/to/your/file.gtf /path/to/your/genome.fasta /path/to/desired/output/dir/``

GTF and FASTA files can be downloaded from Ensembl, UCSC, gencode, refseq, and other online sources.  It is recommended to use the same GTF and FASTA that your STAR index was built with.

starchip-fusions filters using the location of known repeats in bed format as well.  This file will be large (~300MB for human), and can be downloaded from the UCSC table browser:

1.	Go to http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables
2.	Change \'genome\' to your desired genome
3.	Change the following settings\:

	a) group: Repeats
	b) track: RepeatMasker
	c) region: genome
	d) output format: BED
	e) output file: some reasonable name.bed

4.	Click \'get output\' to download your bed file.  
5.	On your local machine sort the bed file: sort -k1,1 -k2,2n repeats.bed > repeats.sorted.bed

starchip-fusions can also make use of known antibody parts, and copy number variants.  These files come with starchip for human hg19 and hg38 in the reference directory.  For other species you can create your own in the simple format:

``Chromosome	StartPosition	EndPosition``

Finally, starchip-fusions uses known gene families and known/common false-positive pairs to filter out fusions which are likely mapping errors or PCR artifacts.  Family data can be downloaded from ensembl biomart:

1.	Go to http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview
2.	Database: Ensembl Genes
3.	Dataset: Your species
4.	Click Attributes on the left hand side. 

	a)	Under GENE dropdown, select only “Associated Gene Name”
	b)	Under PROTEIN FAMILIES AND DOMAINS dropdown select Ensembl Protein Family ID.  

5)	Click Results at the top.
6)	Export the file.  It should have two columns, Family ID and Gene ID.  

Known false positives are stored within data/pseudogenes.txt. In practice, we've found that pseudogenes and tissue specific highly expressed genes are commonly "fused" via PCR template switching errors.  Feel free to put add any additional lines that result from your data to this file in the format

``Gene1Name	Gene2Name``

Parameter Files
---------------
starchip-fusions and starchip-circles rely on parameter files to supply all the information to complete a successful run.  Examples are given in the paramfiles directory, however **you need to customize a parameter file for each run**.  All required and optional parameters are explained here.  We recommend you copy an example parameter file to your working directory and edit it there.   All parameter values are explained at the end of the manual.

Complete Parameter Explanations 
===============================
Fusions Parameter Files
-----------------------

================   ================================================================================================================================================
Parameter           Explanation 
================   ================================================================================================================================================
pairedend          True/false : is your data paired end?
consensus          True/false : do you want a consensus sequence generated for your fusions? Should be true unless you cannot use mafft or samtools for some reason   
splitReads         Integer.  Number of minimum reads that cross fusion border.  Can put \'auto\' to have starchip make a best guess for your sample. 
spancutoff 	   Integer. Number of minimum paired ends to map to opposite ends of a fusion without crossing the fusion site.  Can put \'auto\' to have starchip make a best guess for your sample.  
uniqueReads	   Integer.  Number of minimum unique reads that cross fusion border.  Useful for eliminating fusions whose support comes from a single PCR amplicon.
wiggle	           Integer.  Reads mapping to opposite ends of a fusion without crossing the fusion junction itself have ambiguous fusion site.  Starchip looks for fusions within \'wiggle\' bp of the ambiguous fusion site to share 
overlapLimit	   Integer.  Fusions called less than overlapLimit bp from each other will be merged.
samechrom_wiggle   Integer.  Intrachromosomal fusions must be at least this value apart to be reported.
lopsidedupper	   Float. Starchip will filter out fusions that are imbalanced in the number of reads on one strand vs another.  With unstranded RNA-seq, we expect roughly equal reads to map to the \'top\' strand vs the \'bottom\' strand.  Using the equation: ratio = (top side reads + 0.1) / (bottom side reads + 0.1).  ratio must be below \'lopsidedupper\' and above \'lopsidedlower\'
lopsidedlower	   see above.
genome  String.    Starchip will look for files in the data directory bearing this genome ID.  For example, genome = hg19 will cause starchip to look for and use data/hg19.abparts and data/hg19.cnvs.  
cnvwiggle	   Integer. Skip fusions with an edge within \'cnvwiggle\' bp of a known cnv.
circlesize 	   Integer.  Fusions that appear to be circular RNA (same strand, fusion splices \'backwards\') are skipped.  However, circlesize represents an upper limit for the size of filtered circular RNA.  
refbed		   String.  The bed file generated earlier with gtf2bed.sh.
repeatbed	   String.  The bed file downloaded from UCSC table browser.
refFasta	   String.  A genome fasta file (preferably the one used to build the STAR index).  If not the same it MUST be the same genome build and it must have the same chromosome identifiers.  
splitscoremod	   Float.  Each fusion will have a confidence score generated based on the number of reads of support and the strand imbalance of that support. This score is then adjusted if the read support has a poor skew, if it\'s possible it\'s a read through fusions, and if the fusion sites are in repeats.
spanscoremod	   Float.  See above.
skewpenalty	   Float.  See above.  
repeatpenalty	   Float.  See above.  Score is modified to be score=score*(repeatspenalty^repeats) where a fusion can have 0,1, or 2 sites fall into repeat regions.

CircRNA Parameter Files
-----------------------
================	================================================================================
Parameter
================	================================================================================
readsCutoff		Integer. Minimum number of reads crossing the circular RNA backsplice required.  To check multiple cutoffs (eg to examine 5, 10, and 15 reads, use the following format (within quotes)  "( 5 10 15 )" )
minSubjectLimit		Integer. Minimum number of individuals with \'readsCutoff\' reads required to carry forward a circRNA for analysis. 
cpus			Integer.  Number of threads to use.  If a non-numeric value is given, the command nproc will be used to determine the number of threads.
do_Splice		true/false.  Should the splices within the circRNA be detected and reported?  Linear splices are searched within each circRNA in each individual.  Any linear splice with >= 60% of the read count of the circRNA is considered a splice within the circRNA.  Two files are then created, \*.consensus with most common splice pattern, and \*.allvariants with all reported splice patterns.  
cpmCutoff		Float. Reads counts are loaded into R and log2(CountsPerMillion) is calculated using the limma package.  With cpmCutoff > 0, circRNA with log2(CPM) below this value will be filtered from this analysis.
subjectCPMcutoff	Integer.  See above.  This value is the lower limit for number of individuals required to have the circRNA expressed at a value higher than cpmCutoff. 
annotate		true/false.  Should circRNA be given gene annotations?  Uses refbed.  
refbed			String.  The bed file generated earlier with gtf2bed.sh.	
refFasta	   	String.  A genome fasta file (preferably the one used to build the STAR index).  If not the same it MUST be the same genome build and it must have the same chromosome identifiers.  
starprefix		String.  If you used the star parameter --outFileNamePrefix, give that value here.  E.g. if your star output has a file named \"mydata_Chimeric.out.junction\"  then put \"mydata\_\" for starprefix.
IDstepsback		Integer.  Where in your pathway (position from the right) is the sample identifier.  For example if your star output for **sample1** is in the directory at: |br| /path/to/**sample1**/star/2.4.2/output/Chimeric.out.junction |br| Your IDstepsback is 4.  Alternatively the path |br| /path/to/star/2.4.2/**sample1**/Chimeric.out.junction |br| has IDstepsback value of 1.  
runSTAR 		true/false.  Should STARChip perform alignment of fastq files and realignment with circRNA genomic insertions? If true, provide fastq files, not STAR directories.  
STARgenome		String.  Path to STAR genome to align to.  Only used if runSTAR is true.
STARreadcommand		String.  Command for STAR to read fastq files.  zcat for .gz, cat for .fastq, etc.
